An API endpoint that accepts multiple files and returns a zipped (.zip) folder containing those files.

For this you'll need an npm module that handles multipart form data and one that can zip a folder.

You can upload files from Insomnia like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1grw_MnfiW2CVDPn_qfHJSSu-Z5bqDDfn/view?usp=sharing
